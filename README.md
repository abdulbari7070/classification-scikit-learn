# classification-scikit-learn

Classification using logistic regression using Scikit-learn Python.
In this example we are training a logistic regressor model for classification.
We have data dataset for the house prices.
We are trying to predict that the house value will be above median value or not.
For these kinds of problems classification algorithms are used.

Following are the features of the dataset.
1>  longitude
2>  latitude	
3>  housing_median_age	
4>  total_rooms	
5>  total_bedrooms	
6>  population	
7>  households	
8>  median_income
9>  median_house_value
10> ocean_proximity

Also at the end of the example there is a quick comparision between the predicted values and the actual values.
Accuracy of the algorithm is 82% approx.
